            I could write a lot of thoughts & feelings about Angie. She's been my saving grace through quite a bit. I know that a lot of people pray for me, but she has REALLY been praying for me.

            There's been a huge amount of support from her through this journey. She's been a little sis that I wouldn have never thought would be such a huge inspiration. You are sometimes reminded that throwing in the towel is an option, but with her, she's seen me drive for and go after just about anything and everything I've wanted.

            My friendship with her has been one of a kind. We both know that communicating is our strongest suit. We are constantly wanting to see the best version of ourselves in each other. We are far from perfect, but we know that we are truly meant to be part of each other's lives.
