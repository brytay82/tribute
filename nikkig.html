        Between me working on opening my throat chakra & talking more, or her reminding me the importance of checking in with not only Bryan, but my inner child, Nikki has been a great friend that was able to provide quite a fair share of confidence in me as I have offered her over the last few years.

        When becoming friends with other people, you sometimes don't know where the friendship is bound to go. Talking with both her and her husband (friendly reminder...men and women can be friends AND NOTHING MORE), they have been very embracing as an inner family. She's been the person who has had to tell me about myself when I was starting to go a little off course.

        It's a unique connection because she's going to officialy be my first website I'll have complete that I can add to my portfolio for a designed website. She's been patient with my coding journey along with business journey. You can never go wrong in having someone who's there for you every step of the way, even when you're ready to throw in the towel. Even before working on this, I mentioned to her how I just wasn't into doing any coding, & my body said "take a break"...so I did just that...took a break, & I was OK with.
