            As I mentioned before, I could easily place this all on one person, but there are multiple people who have helped me along this journey. Special has been one of them hands down. The picture shows her as using one of her many planners, but our friendship has been bigger than planning. She's REALLY been the truth definition of an accountability partner.

            One thing I can say about Special that is very key with this coding and development journey is that she has put me (along with my confidence) in rooms that I normally wouldn't have allowed myself, or my confidence, to be in. I think that sometimes we want to see the best in ourselves, but need someone else to really bring the truth to light. She's that person for me.

            I have been the tech plug, & she's been the person making sure that I help in any way possible, whether it's giving her a suggestion or looking over recommendations. The options have been endless, & that's why I will truly value her as a friend by far.
