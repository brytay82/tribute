        <p>
            I have been down many roads & obstacles, & I gotta come clean...my circle has been nothing short of amazing. I can definitely say that I take a lot of credit, but the truth is that there have been a lot of people who are immediately around me who have seen me grow & evolve to where I am now. This coding journey started back in March, & I REALLY had to dedicate myself to my desk, my change of routine, & some massive disconnection. However, thanks to many of my friends, I was able to somehow get it done & find my space that is now considered home, aka the software development/engineering space. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I contine, I would like to share one piece of information...I was able to learn in my software development journey that both Software Developer and Software Engineer are one in the same. It's mainly for titling purposes. I just wanted to be sure to share that before going any further. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One final thought...I know that a lot of people are gonna say "What about my help along this journey?", and to be fair, there are quite a few people who have helped me along the way. Listing every single person is humanly impossible. I know that coding will truly be placing me in different rooms, & I will be sure that those who have helped me get to where I am get their proper credibility in the long haul.
