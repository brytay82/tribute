            This might be the surprising factor of this list. I have a lot of men who are mentors & positive role models. Many of them have been my role models & I've been theirs. That being said, when anyone hears me say the words "my boy", they easily know I'm talking about Lonnie. He's reminded me the importance of family & friendship. One of his key tags/phrases he constatnly uses is #FOE #WAWG, which stands for "Family over everything, we all we got", & he brings the importance of family & friends by far.

            Our friendship started in the place that was a little different from the others...the basketball court. He literaly gave me my nickname "Somethin' for the people", because I was not your average lefty. I can say to this day that he is one of the few people that will get me out of my tech or mind funks. He will tell me what I don't wanna hear, even if I'm not equipped to hear or address it.

            I tribute this page to him because not only has been a friend, but he has been family. I've been very receptive of information with him. He's one of the few people who I can have a hoops conversation with and not be annoyed. We talk ball & sports all day for real. He's just a cool dude to kick it with. He's also been my gaming plug for YEARS. I can still remember introducing him to my retro console, & I almost thought I wasn't gonna get it back, but we have been able to hang and be there for each other every step of the way, & that's what people need in the end.
